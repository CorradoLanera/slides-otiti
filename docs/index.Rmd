Good moarning, I am Corrado Lanera and I have just finished my third
year Ph.D. at the Unit of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health,
at the University of Padova.

Today I will present you an **overview of the final work** inlcuded in my 
dissertation, that aims to identify and classsify different types of 
otitis automatically and using only free-text from prediatric medical 
reports. 

This is a **joint work with** three other groups:
 
 - the **Pedianet** society which collected and provided the data;
 - the **Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases** of the university
   of Padova which created the gold standard, motivated the study and 
   analyzed the results from the clinical point of view
   
 - and **Health Language Processing Center** at the University of
   Pennsylvania, in wich I have spent my visiting period during the
   Ph.D., and where I have developed all the computational aspects of 
   the analyses

# Outline

Overview: classification of otitis

Task: multi-class classification

Database:<img src="images/logopedianet.png", width = "20%", align = "center">

Metrics: scores and human-performances

Project plan: flowchart

Deep-learning approach: architectures explored

Results

Final remarks and conclusions


???

So, we will start with a quick overview on the otitis and the importance
of their classification.

Next, we will describe which classes we are interested to classify and 
we will explore the main details of the database we used.

To evaluate any models, we need some metrics, so, before to describe the
flowchart we adopted for the analyses, we will explore teh metrics and 
the reference we considered.

After that we will show the deep-learning architectures explored and 
trained to create teh final ensamble model.

At the end we conclude reporting the results achieved, concluding with 
some highlights.

- Otitis media is one of the **most common infections in pediatrics**
  population.

- It is an **inflamamtion with possible fluid accumulation** in the
  middle ear

- and there is continuing interest in defining the incidence and the
  burden of acute cases, being one of the main cause of antibiotics
  prescriptions in children.
  
- This is also highlighted by the **chellenges in the diagnoses** and by 
the **frequently little attention in following the guidlines**, like the
**wait-and-see approach** that discourage early antibiotics prescription,
reducing their usage and the adverse events associated with that.

<ol start="0">

<li>an otitis case which is not media (whatever severity)</li><br>

<li>a media otitis which is not acute</li><br>

Pedianet was investigated in 2019 by Barbieri et.al\* on data from 
2010 to 2015 for similar task **on primary diagnosis only**: adding even
the diaries in a traditional manual human-driven analysis proved to be 
too costly in terms both of person-time (years) and economic resources

It is necessary to develop an **accurate** system able to classify all
the Pedianet records **automatically** investigating **all the textual

Gold-standard definition:
  - two independent expert annotators (weighted Cohen's Kappa = $0.89$)
  - one pediatrician specialized in infectious diseases decided where the experts shown disagreement:*

Expert annotators | Accuracy [%] | Balanced F1 [%]
:--------------: | :----------: | :-------------:

       B         |     95.80    |       90.12



$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{|\text{true positives}|}{|\text{records}|}$

$\text{Balanced F1} = \frac{\text{balanced precision} \cdot \text{balanced recall}}{\text{balanced precision} + \text{balanced recall}}$

$\text{Balanced precision} = \frac{\sum_{i\in\text{classes}}\frac{|\text{true positives in }i|}{|\text{labelled like }i|}}{|\text{classes}|}$

# **Final remarks**




---
class: middle

.pull-left[
## .center[Strenghts]
- embedding: no more needs to hand-craft features
- deep learning:
  - automatical detection and modeling of non linearities and
    interactions
  - update models w/ new data
  - use pre-trained or merge multiple models
  - can take advantage of more data than shallow models
]

.pull-right[
## .center[Weakness]
- our human-performance estimation is not based at the professional levels
- missing of computational power (i.e, GPUs) for deeper networks, e.g., 

  - recurrent
  - BERT
  - XLNet
]

## .center[Possible improvement]

- improve the gold standard:
  - quality  (human-performance level)
  - accuracy (error analyses)
  - quantity (more training records / active learning)
- deeper networks / advanced architectures
- different weighting schemes for the ensamble

# **Conclusions**




---
class: middle

# Deep Learning Approach to Text-Mining EHR

- Can be used to identifying and classifying diagnosis from (huge
  ammount of) free text
  
- Quality comparable with human-performances

- Trained models can be adopted on other health care databases,
  different from the original one

- It can improve healthcare research limiting human errors and time,
speeding up databases interrogations
