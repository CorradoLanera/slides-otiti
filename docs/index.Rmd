... and the main cause of antibiotic prescriptions 

_[...] diagnosis is often challenging in everyday
practice because the symptoms are non-specific or
absent, and frequently little attention is paid to the
issued guidelines._

_[...] there has been a continuing interest in
defining the incidence and burden of AOM in different
populations, including those in which the offer and
coverage of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
has been considerably heterogeneous_*

# **Task**<br>multi-class classification

class: middle

Based on data provided in the EHRs at the visit level, decide if it reports:

<small>
1. whatever other than an otitis case
1. an otitis case which is not media (whatever severity)
1. a media otitis which is not acute
1. <img src="images/aom.jpg", width = "20%", align = "center">
  an AOM (w/o tympanic membrane perforation, nor recurrent)

1. <img src="images/aom_perforation.jpg", width = "20%", align = "center">
  an AOM with tympanic membrane perforation
1. a recurrent AOM

**snapshot considerd**: from 1st January 2004 to 23rd August 2017

**records**: $6,903,035$

**pediatricians**: $144$ (troughout Italy)

**children**: $216,976$

**fields** (all free-text, Italian-language):
  - diagnosis
  - signs-and-symptoms
  - diary
  - prescription
  - visit description
  - visit result

Investigated in 2012 by Barbieri E. et al. 2018\* on data from 2010 to
2015 for similar task **on primary diagnosis only**: adding even the 
diaries in a traditional manual human-driven analysis proved to be too
costly in terms both of person-time (years) and economic resources

It is necessary to develop a **accurate** system able to classify all
the Pedianet records **automatically** investigating **all the textual
fields** in the database.

# **Metrics**<br>scores and human-performances

class: middle

Gold-standard definition:
  - two independent expert annotators (weighted Cohen''s Kappa = $0.89$)
  - one pediatrician specialized in infectious diseases decided on the differences:*

Expert annotators | Accuracy [%] | Balanced F1 [%]
:--------------: | :----------: | :-------------:
       A         |     95.91    |       93.47
       B         |     95.80    |       90.12



$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{|\text{true positives}|}{|\text{records}|}$

$\text{Balanced F1} = \frac{\text{balanced precision} * \text{balanced recall}}{\text{balanced precision} + \text{balanced recall}}$

$\text{Balanced precision} = \frac{\sum_{i\in\text{classes}}\frac{|\text{true positives in }i|}{|\text{labelled like }i|}}{|\text{classes}|}$

$\text{Balanced precision} = \frac{\sum_{i\in\text{classes}}\frac{|\text{true positives in }i|}{|\text{class }i|}}{|\text{classes}|}$

# **Conclusions**




---
class: middle

- Potential of deep learning models in identifying and classifying
  diagnosis from free text
  
- Could be adopted in other health care databases
- Can improve healthcare research limiting human errors and time
  speeding databases interrogations

.pull-left[
# Strenghts
- embedding: no more needs to hand-crafting features
- deep learning:
  - automatical detection and modeling of non linearities and
    interactions
  - update models w/ new data
  - use pre-trained or merge multiple models
  - can take advantage of more data than shallow models
]

.pull-right[
# Weakness
- human-performance not based on professionals levels
- missing computational power (i.e, GPUs) for
  - Recurrent networks
  - BERT
  - XLNet
  - ...
